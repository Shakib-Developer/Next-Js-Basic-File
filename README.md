1. Pages:

index.js, about.js, etc.: These files represent individual pages of the application. Each file in the pages/ directory corresponds to a unique route in the application. For example, index.js represents the home page, and about.js represents the about page. These pages are automatically server-rendered and can include both server-side and client-side code.
2. Components:

ComponentName.js: These are reusable React components that can be used across different pages. You can create components in the components/ directory. For example, you can have a Header.js component that displays the header section on multiple pages.
3. Public:

images/, fonts/, etc.: The public/ directory is used to store static assets that can be directly accessed by the client. For example, you can place images in the images/ directory, and they will be available at the root URL.
4. Styles:

globals.css, styles.module.css, etc.: The styles/ directory is used to store CSS styles for the application. The globals.css file contains global styles that will be applied across all pages. You can also use CSS modules (e.g., styles.module.css) to scope styles to specific components.
